# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part was setting up the board through the making of a list.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I could make a function that places x's and o's in randomly places on the board when playing against the player. I could also ceate a reset function that clears the random places for x and o. 
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I think that I could possibly get the computer to respond to certain placements of x's and o's that the player makes. For example if the player puts x or o in a corner then the computer puts it in the opposite corner.
